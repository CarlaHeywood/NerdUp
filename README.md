We had 24 hours. We did not have the skills needed nor the time to fully develop this project so we created a general outline or framework by linking simple HTML pages, integrating CodeMirror, and put together a presentation to showcase our ideas. This was our Demo. 

<strong>Concept:<br></strong>
NerdUp is a platform to connect with other student programmers around the world. Once logged in, you can enter your personal skill level for different programming languages and collaborate with others on your homework or project using a text editor that provides syntax highlighting similar to Eclipse or VS Code, and the ability to intereact with the document simultaneously and remotely similar to Google Docs. 
If you have a project that you wanted to find someone to work with on, you will log in and press the "Pair Me" button. This will pair you with a random programmer around the world. You can press the as many times need to find a new partner. You can manaually add people with a link if you want to add to your team.
You have found a soild partner and have encountered another road block but don't want to lose the intereaction, you can resquest the help of a tutor.
